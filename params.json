{"name":"Classify","tagline":"Learning the basics of classification in Python.","body":"### Classify.\r\nThis repository consists of IPython tutorials aimed at newbies who want to understand how classification works. Each notebook covers a topic, explained in text and Python code. Most of the content has been derived from the website, guidetodatamining.com. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd classify/\r\n$ ipython notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notebooks\r\n<hr>\r\n##### [Introduction to recommendation systems]\r\ncollaborative filtering. distances. minkowski distance metric. Using pearson correlation & cosine similarity to standardize user ratings.  dense and sparse data. basics of how kNN works.\r\n<br>\r\n##### [Filtering]\r\nItem-based filtering. Comparing it to collaborative filtering. Cosine similarity for items. Adjusting user ratings. Similarity matrix. Normalizing, denormalizing and predicting scores.
